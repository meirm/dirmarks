## Overview

Implement rich visual formatting and interactive features for bookmark display to improve usability and reduce cognitive load when navigating large bookmark collections. This feature will make bookmark identification faster through visual cues and provide a more modern, user-friendly CLI experience.

## User Stories

### Visual Bookmark Identification

As a developer with many bookmarks, I want to see color-coded and icon-enhanced bookmark listings, so that I can quickly identify bookmark types and categories at a glance.

When I list my bookmarks, each entry shows with an appropriate icon (folder, git repo, project type) and color coding based on its category. This visual differentiation helps me scan through long lists quickly without reading every path.

### Interactive Selection

As a CLI user, I want an interactive menu for bookmark selection, so that I can browse and select bookmarks using arrow keys instead of remembering names or indices.

When I run `dir -i` or `dir --interactive`, I get an interactive menu where I can navigate with arrow keys, search by typing, and select with Enter. This provides a more intuitive experience similar to modern CLI tools.

### Rich Status Display

As a power user, I want to see additional bookmark metadata in the listing, so that I can make informed decisions about which bookmark to use.

The enhanced listing shows last access time, bookmark usage frequency, and visual indicators for bookmark health (exists/missing). This helps me identify stale bookmarks and my most-used directories.

## Spec Scope

1. **Icon System** - Display contextual icons/emojis for different directory types
2. **Enhanced Color Coding** - Rich color schemes for categories, status, and metadata
3. **Interactive Menu** - Arrow-key navigation and selection interface
4. **Rich Formatting** - Tables, alignment, and visual separators for better readability
5. **Status Indicators** - Visual cues for bookmark validity and usage patterns

## Out of Scope

- GUI application or web interface
- Custom themes beyond predefined color schemes
- Bookmark preview or directory contents display
- Animation or progressive rendering
- Mouse support in terminal

## Expected Deliverable

1. Bookmark listings display with icons and rich color formatting
2. Interactive selection mode activated with `dir -i` or `dir --interactive`
3. Enhanced listing format with metadata and visual organization
