# Bookmark Organization System - Lite Summary

Implement a category and tag-based organization system for bookmarks that allows users to group, filter, and manage their directory shortcuts more efficiently. Users can assign categories/tags to bookmarks, filter listings by category, and benefit from color-coded visual organization to reduce lookup time and improve workflow efficiency.

## Key Points
- Category and tag-based bookmark organization with hierarchical support
- Command-line filtering with `dir -l --category [name]` and `--tag [name]`
- Color-coded terminal output for visual bookmark identification and grouping
