> Spec: Bookmark Organization System
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a category and tag-based organization system for bookmarks that allows users to group, filter, and manage their directory shortcuts more efficiently. This feature will reduce bookmark lookup time and enable better organization for users managing dozens of frequently-used paths.

## User Stories

### Organizing Work Projects

As a developer working on multiple projects, I want to categorize my bookmarks by project name, so that I can quickly filter and navigate to project-specific directories.

When I add a bookmark, I can assign it to a category like "work", "personal", or "client-abc". When listing bookmarks, I can filter by category to see only relevant bookmarks, reducing cognitive load when switching contexts.

### Hierarchical Organization

As a system administrator managing multiple environments, I want to create hierarchical bookmark structures, so that I can organize bookmarks by environment and subsystem.

I can create nested categories like "production/databases" and "staging/configs" to maintain a clear mental model of my infrastructure. The system displays these hierarchies clearly with indentation or tree-like visualization.

### Quick Category Navigation

As a power user with 50+ bookmarks, I want to quickly list bookmarks by category with color-coding, so that I can visually identify and navigate to the right bookmark faster.

When I run `dir -l --category work`, I see only work-related bookmarks with consistent color coding. Different categories have distinct colors making it easy to scan and identify bookmark groups at a glance.

## Spec Scope

1. **Category Management** - Add, remove, and modify categories for bookmark organization
2. **Tag System** - Support multiple tags per bookmark for flexible classification
3. **Filtered Listing** - List bookmarks filtered by category or tag with command options
4. **Color Coding** - Display categories and tags with configurable terminal colors
5. **Hierarchical Structure** - Support nested categories with parent-child relationships

## Out of Scope

- Bookmark search functionality (fuzzy matching)
- Import/export of categories (separate feature)
- GUI interface for category management
- Automatic category suggestions
- Category-based permissions or access control

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can assign categories and tags when creating or updating bookmarks
2. Command `dir -l --category [name]` filters bookmarks by category
3. Terminal output shows color-coded categories for visual organization
