## Overview

Implement comprehensive import and export capabilities for bookmark collections, enabling users to backup, share, and synchronize their bookmarks across different systems and teams. This feature will facilitate bookmark portability and collaboration while maintaining data integrity and compatibility.

## User Stories

### Bookmark Backup and Restore

As a user who values data safety, I want to export my bookmarks to a file, so that I can backup my configuration and restore it if needed.

I can run `dirmarks --export bookmarks.json` to create a complete backup of all my bookmarks, categories, and settings. If I need to restore after a system reinstall or move to a new machine, I can run `dirmarks --import bookmarks.json` to restore my entire bookmark configuration instantly.

### Team Bookmark Sharing

As a team lead, I want to export project-specific bookmarks and share them with my team, so that everyone has the same directory shortcuts for our project structure.

I can export bookmarks filtered by category using `dirmarks --export project-bookmarks.yaml --category project-abc`. Team members can then import these bookmarks with `dirmarks --import project-bookmarks.yaml --merge` to add them to their existing bookmarks without overwriting their personal shortcuts.

### Cross-System Synchronization

As a developer working on multiple machines, I want to export and import bookmarks in different formats, so that I can maintain consistent bookmarks across all my development environments.

I can export bookmarks in JSON, YAML, or CSV format depending on my needs. The system handles path translation for different operating systems, converting between Unix and Windows paths automatically when importing on a different platform.

## Spec Scope

1. **Export Formats** - Support JSON, YAML, and CSV export formats with full fidelity
2. **Import Modes** - Replace, merge, or selective import of bookmark collections
3. **Category Filtering** - Export specific categories or tags only
4. **Path Translation** - Automatic path conversion between Unix and Windows systems
5. **Validation System** - Verify bookmark validity and handle conflicts during import

## Out of Scope

- Real-time synchronization or cloud storage
- Binary or encrypted export formats
- Automatic version control integration
- Database export/import
- Network-based sharing protocols

## Expected Deliverable

1. Export bookmarks with `dirmarks --export filename.{json|yaml|csv}`
2. Import bookmarks with `dirmarks --import filename.{json|yaml|csv}` with merge options
3. Selective export/import by category or tag for targeted sharing
