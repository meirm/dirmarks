## 2025-09-02: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Dirmarks will focus exclusively on filesystem bookmarking for CLI users, maintaining simplicity and performance as core principles while avoiding feature creep into broader workspace management.

### Context

During initial product definition, several expansion opportunities emerged:
- Full workspace management (multiple windows, sessions)
- File bookmarking (not just directories) 
- GUI application development
- Integration with cloud storage services

### Rationale

1. **Target User Focus**: CLI power users value speed and simplicity over feature richness
2. **Market Positioning**: Clear differentiation from existing tools by staying focused
3. **Technical Simplicity**: Narrow scope enables robust, fast implementation
4. **Maintainability**: Limited feature set reduces long-term maintenance burden

## 2025-09-02: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Python 3.9+ with Poetry for package management, targeting PyPI distribution with shell function integration rather than native binary compilation.

### Context

Considered alternatives:
- **Go/Rust**: Native binary with no runtime dependencies
- **Node.js**: JavaScript ecosystem familiarity
- **Shell scripts**: Pure bash/zsh implementation
- **Python**: Current implementation language

### Rationale

1. **Existing Codebase**: Already implemented and working in Python
2. **Cross-Platform**: Python provides excellent cross-platform compatibility
3. **CLI Ecosystem**: Rich Python CLI development tools (click, argparse)
4. **Installation Experience**: pip installation familiar to target users
5. **Development Velocity**: Faster iteration vs native compilation

## 2025-09-02: Shell Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture  
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, UX Designer

### Decision

Generate shell functions that source into user's shell rather than using subprocesses or external binaries for navigation commands.

### Context

Navigation requires changing the parent shell's working directory, which subprocesses cannot accomplish. Options evaluated:
- **Shell functions**: Generated functions sourced into shell
- **Aliases**: Simple command aliasing
- **Subprocess with output**: Return cd commands for evaluation
- **Shell scripts**: Separate script files

### Rationale

1. **Technical Requirement**: Only shell functions can change parent directory
2. **Performance**: No subprocess overhead for navigation
3. **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing shell workflow
4. **Compatibility**: Works consistently across bash and zsh

## 2025-09-02: Storage and Data Format

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security

### Decision

Store bookmarks in JSON format within user's home directory (`~/.dirmarks/`) with human-readable structure for easy debugging and manual editing.

### Context

Storage options considered:
- **JSON files**: Human-readable, easy parsing
- **SQLite database**: Query capabilities, atomic operations  
- **Plain text**: Simple but limited structure
- **Binary format**: Compact but not user-editable

### Rationale

1. **Simplicity**: JSON provides good balance of structure and readability
2. **User Control**: Users can manually edit bookmark files if needed
3. **Portability**: Easy to backup, version control, and transfer
4. **Development Speed**: No database setup or migration complexity
5. **Debugging**: Human-readable for troubleshooting

## 2025-09-02: Command Interface Design

**ID:** DEC-005  
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** User Experience
**Stakeholders:** UX Designer, Product Owner

### Decision

Use `dm` as the primary command with subcommands (e.g., `dm add`, `dm list`) while supporting direct navigation via `dm bookmark-name` for frequently used operations.

### Context

Command interface options:
- **Single command with flags**: `dirmarks --add name`
- **Subcommand structure**: `dm add name`, `dm list`
- **Hybrid approach**: Both subcommands and direct navigation
- **Separate commands**: `dmadd`, `dmlist`, etc.

### Rationale

1. **User Experience**: `dm bookmark-name` provides fastest navigation
2. **Discoverability**: `dm list`, `dm add` are self-explanatory
3. **Consistency**: Follows standard CLI patterns (git, docker)
4. **Memorability**: Short, memorable primary command
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new subcommands

## 2025-09-02: Multi-Shell Support Priority

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Feature Priority
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Initial release supports bash and zsh only, with fish and PowerShell support planned for Phase 3 based on user demand.

### Context

Shell ecosystem analysis:
- **bash**: Most widely used, especially in enterprise
- **zsh**: Growing popularity, macOS default
- **fish**: Modern features, smaller but enthusiastic user base
- **PowerShell**: Windows dominance, cross-platform growth

### Rationale

1. **Market Coverage**: bash + zsh covers >80% of target users
2. **Implementation Complexity**: Each shell requires custom integration code
3. **Validation Strategy**: Prove product-market fit before expanding
4. **Resource Allocation**: Focus development effort on core features first
5. **User Feedback**: Let demand drive additional shell support priority
