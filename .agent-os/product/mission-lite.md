# Dirmarks Mission (Lite)

Dirmarks transforms CLI navigation by letting users bookmark frequently-used directories with memorable names. Instead of typing `/very/long/complex/project/path` repeatedly, bookmark it as `proj` and navigate instantly with `dm proj`.

**Value & Differentiator:** Unlike shell aliases or history, Dirmarks provides persistent, organized, cross-shell bookmark management with semantic naming and index-based quick access - turning repetitive directory navigation into single-command efficiency.
